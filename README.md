Hi there 👋,

I'm Ritesh Nikhoriya — a Senior Frontend Engineer focused on building fast, accessible, and delightful web experiences. I blend strong fundamentals in JavaScript/TypeScript with deep hands-on experience in React and Next.js, and I bring a unique edge from my background in blockchain engineering by crafting seamless Web3-enabled UIs. 🚀

I’m a product-minded frontend developer who loves turning complex requirements into clean, reusable components and scalable design systems. Whether it’s improving Core Web Vitals, optimizing bundle sizes, or making interfaces accessible for everyone, I care about details that move the needle for users and businesses alike. I’ve also shipped several dApp frontends and wallet integrations, bridging on-chain logic with intuitive UX.
